Repository containing code and data for the paper: Workforce Skills as Performance Indicators: Analyzing Firm Job Postings


Abstract
This paper examines the link between firm performance and real-time skill demands in job postings using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By analyzing job ads from platforms like JobIndex and JobNet and classifying skills with the ESCO taxonomy, we identify the impact of specific skills on firm stock prices. Our findings show that STEM and management skills positively influence firm performance, while creative and vocational skills do not have a significant effect. This approach offers a more accurate assessment of skill demand in the labor market, providing valuable insights for investors and businesses in dynamic financial environments.
